Code takes picture every ~2 seconds.

This will take around 9000 photos in our 3 hour run time.
Stores these in a 'data' directory in the root project folder.
Uses no external libraries other than any mentioned on the AstroPi Guide.

MachineLearning code is attached but not run on the ISS.

Photos are taken and ML code will be run on Earth.
